## Intent
The Leader/Followers pattern provides a concurrency model where multiple 
threads can efficiently de-multiplex events and dispatch event handlers 
that process I/O handles shared by the threads.

## Class diagram

## Applicability
Use Leader-Followers pattern when

* a system possesses following characteristics:
  * the system must perform tasks in response to external events that occur asynchronously, like hardware interrupts in OS
  * it is inefficient to dedicate separate thread of control to perform synchronous I/O for each external source of event
  * the higher level tasks in the system can be simplified significantly if I/O is performed synchronously.
* one or more tasks in a system must run in a single thread of control, while other tasks may benefit from multi-threading.
