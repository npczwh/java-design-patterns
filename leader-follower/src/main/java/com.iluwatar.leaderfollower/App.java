/**
 * Leader Follower is a concurrency pattern where multiple threads can efficiently de-multiplex
 * events and dispatch to event handlers. One may think of it as a taxi station at night, where all
 * the drivers are sleeping except for one, the leader. The ThreadPool is a station managing many
 * threads - cabs.
 *
 * <p>The leader is waiting for an IO event on the TaskSet, so as a driver waits for a client.
 * When a client arrives (in the form of a Handle identifying the IO event), the leader driver wakes
 * up another driver to be the next leader and serves the request from his passenger. While he is
 * taking the client to the given address (calling TaskHandler and handing over Handle to it) the
 * next leader can concurrently serve another passenger. When a driver finishes he take his taxi
 * back to the station and falls asleep if the station is not empty. Otherwise he become the leader
 *
 * <p>In this example we use ThreadPool which basically acts as the ThreadPool. One of the
 * Workers becomes Leader and listens on the {@link TaskSet} for work. {@link TaskSet} basically
 * acts as the source of input events for the {@link Worker}, who are spawned and controlled by the
 * {@link WorkStation} . When {@link Task} arrives then the leader takes the work and calls the
 * {@link TaskHandler}. However it also selects one of the waiting Workers as leader, who can then
 * process the next work and so on.
 *
 * <p>The pros for this pattern are:
 * It enhances CPU cache affinity and eliminates unbound allocation and data buffer sharing between
 * threads by reading the request into buffer space allocated on the stack of the leader or by using
 * the Thread-Specific Storage pattern [22] to allocate memory. It minimizes locking overhead by not
 * exchanging data between threads, thereby reducing thread synchronization. In bound handle/thread
 * associations, the leader thread dispatches the event based on the I/O handle. It can minimize
 * priority inversion because no extra queuing is introduced in the server It does not require a
 * context switch to handle each event, reducing the event dispatching latency. Note that promoting
 * a follower thread to fulfill the leader role requires a context switch. Programming simplicity:
 * The Leader/Follower pattern simplifies the programming of concurrency models where multiple
 * threads can receive requests, process responses, and demultiplex connections using a shared
 * handle set. The cons are: complex, network IO can be a bottleneck, Lack of flexibility
